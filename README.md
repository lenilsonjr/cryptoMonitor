# cryptoMonitor :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I made cryptoMonitor [to learn React](https://github.com/lenilsonjr/LearningReact). It uses CryptoCompare's web socket to keep an eye on the positions you insert. :moneybag:

If you need a serious business crypto tracker, I use and recommend [Coin Portfolio](https://www.coin-portfolio.com/). :robot:

## Running it locally :computer:
```
git clone git@github.com:lenilsonjr/cryptoMonitor.git
cd cryptoMonitor
npm install
npm start
```

## Contributing :bulb:
You can contribue to cryptoMonitor by forking and sending a pull request with your new feature or bug fix.

A huge thanks to [CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) for making such a wonderful API and Web Socket.
